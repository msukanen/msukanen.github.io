# Various web things (to be) ...
* Matrix 3D Rain - a 3D Matrix-style effect @ https://msukanen.github.io/matrix-rain.html

## Development
Note that `./dist/` directory in `package.json` refers to the ultimate non-repository destination
of HTML, CSS and JavaScript stuff. YMMV - set "publish" parts in `package.json` as you see fit.

### Requirements
* shx
* TypeScript
* Dart-SDK
* Dart Sass

#### Getting 'shx'
* `npm install -g shx`

#### Getting 'TypeScript'
* `npm install -g typescript`

### The Other Things
I use **Chocolatey** to manage some packages, and so should you ;-)

Note that 'choco' needs to be ran as an admin unless you know what you're doing and/or have special needs.

* `choco install dart-sdk`
* `choco install sass`
